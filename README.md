# Code-Player-using-JQuery
Code Player is a web application built using JQuery. This app is basically a replication of the site jsbin.com, which is used to debug user's HTML, CSS and Javascript codes within the web page itself.

<p>It has a nav-bar with 'htnl', 'css', 'javascript', 'output' toggalable buttons. html and output buttons are fixed. </p>

<p> once they are clicked the site automatically resizes based on the number of active buttons </p>

<p> The ouptut window is an iframe where it displays the output </p>

<p>As soon as user writes some code in any of the panel it automatically updates in the iframe i.e., in output window </p>

<p> .eval() is used to execute javascript code, .val() is used for html and css codes </p>

<p> toggle classes are added using jquery </p>
